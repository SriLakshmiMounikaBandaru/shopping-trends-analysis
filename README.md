# Shopping Trends Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Shopping Trends Analysis** project aims to explore customer purchasing behaviors by analyzing various attributes of a shopping dataset. This project provides insights into customer demographics, preferences, and purchase patterns. The findings can assist businesses in improving marketing strategies, optimizing inventory, and personalizing customer experiences.

2. **Age**: Age of the customer.
3. **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
4. **Item Purchased**: The item purchased by the customer.
5. **Category**: Category of the item purchased.
6. **Purchase Amount (USD)**: The amount of the purchase in USD.
7. **Location**: Location where the purchase was made.
8. **Size**: Size of the purchased item.
9. **Color**: Color of the purchased item.
10. **Season**: Season during which the purchase was made.
11. **Review Rating**: Rating given by the customer for the purchased item.
12. **Subscription Status**: Indicates if the customer has a subscription (Yes/No).
13. **Shipping Type**: Type of shipping chosen by the customer.
14. **Discount Applied**: Indicates if a discount was applied to the purchase (Yes/No).
15. **Promo Code Used**: Indicates if a promo code was used for the purchase (Yes/No).
16. **Previous Purchases**: Number of previous purchases made by the customer.
17. **Payment Method**: Customer's most preferred payment method.
18. **Frequency of Purchases**: Frequency at which the customer makes purchases (e.g., Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly).

## Key Questions
Here are some questions the project seeks to answer:

1. What is the overall distribution of customer ages in the dataset?
2. How does the average purchase amount vary across different product categories?
3. Which gender has the highest number of purchases?
4. What are the most commonly purchased items in each category?
5. Are there specific seasons or months where customer spending is significantly higher?
6. What is the average rating given by customers for each product category?
7. Are there notable differences in purchase behavior between subscribed and non-subscribed customers?
8. Which payment method is the most popular among customers?
9. Do customers who use promo codes spend more than those who donâ€™t?
10. How does the frequency of purchases vary across different age groups?
11. Are there correlations between the size of the product and the purchase amount?
12. Which shipping type is preferred by customers for different product categories?
13. How does the presence of a discount affect customer purchase decisions?
14. Are there specific colors that are more popular among customers?
15. What is the average number of previous purchases made by customers?
16. How does the purchase amount differ based on customer review ratings?
17. Are there noticeable differences in purchase behavior between different locations?
18. Is there a relationship between customer age and the category of products purchased?
19. How does the average purchase amount differ between male and female customers?

## Analysis Tools and Techniques
To perform the analysis, the following tools and techniques will be used:

1. **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature encoding.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and distributions to gain insights.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying correlations and patterns in the data.
5. **Machine Learning Models (if applicable)**: For predicting customer behavior or segmenting customers.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Load and understand the structure of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data consistency and handle missing or incorrect values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore data distributions, correlations, and key metrics.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
5. **Modeling and Predictions (Optional)**: Build predictive models, if needed, for insights like customer segmentation or purchase forecasting.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights.
